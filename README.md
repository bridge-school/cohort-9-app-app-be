## Installation

```sh
$ npm install
```

## Setup the app for local development

We are using Firebase [cloud fire store](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) for our database.

To setup a connection to the database:

1. Have a look in your project slack channel for a pinned JSON file called `firebase-credentials.json`.
2. Create a `firebase-credentials.json` file in the root directory of this repository and copy the contents from the file in the slack channel
3. Run `yarn start:local` and if everything is running smoothly you should see no errors
4. To test your server is running correctly, go to `http://localhost:8081/health` in your browser. If you see `{ ok: 'OK' }` then everything is running as expected. If you're not seeing this, reach out to your tech lead or mentor over slack to help you debug!

To query the database you will need to `require` the `db` instance that is exported from `db/index.js`. You can use the [firebase docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/get-data) and have a look under the node.js tab for examples.

## Run the app for local development

```sh
$ npm run start:local
```

## Run the app in production

```
$ npm start
```

## Folder Structure

```
   |-api
   |-db
   |-middleware
   |-routes
   |---health
   |-utils
```

### `api`

This is where you add new routes, see the example `health` route.

### `db`

This is where the Firebase connection is configured. To query the database you will need to `require` the `db` instance that is exported from `db/index.js`.

### `middleware`

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.

Middleware can be at the application level or at the router level. You won't be interacting with this folder much.

### `routes`

This is where all the logic for your endpoints will live. You should make a new folder under `routes` for each set of endpoints you will write, similar to the `health` folder that exists as an example.

### `utils`

This is a multi-purpose folder for any extra utility functions that you might want to reuse throughout your app.

## Commit messages

In order to keep a clean git history merges should always be squashed with a consistent commit message style.
